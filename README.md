# ðŸŒ± Plant Disease Calculator (Tomato & Potato)

This project uses **Machine Learning** in Python to detect and calculate plant diseases for **tomato and potato crops**.  
It helps farmers and researchers identify diseases early and take preventive actions.  
The dataset includes common plant diseases such as **Early Blight, Late Blight, and Leaf Spot**.  
We use **image classification techniques** with models like CNN to achieve accurate predictions.  
The project is implemented in **Python** with libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and OpenCV.  
Users can input plant leaf images, and the system predicts the disease type.  
The model aims to support precision agriculture and reduce crop losses.
